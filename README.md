# KISy - Customer Information System
Attention: [MDB React Pro](https://mdbootstrap.com/products/react-ui-kit/) (Material Design for Bootstrap) is required to run this application. MDB React Pro is not included in this repository, due to MDB excluding Open Source Projects from their license.

## Getting Started
To test, contribute or just see what we did follow few easy steps:
- purchase a MDB React Pro [here](https://mdbootstrap.com/products/react-ui-kit/) and download the compressed file
- extract the file and run `npm install` (or `yarn install` if you don't use NPM). This will automatically unzip `mdbreact-x.x.x.tgz` and create a ReactJS project
- clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/aichner/KISy-Webapp.git .`
- cd to the directory with the repository
- copy the `/dist` directory from the MDB React Pro project and paste it in the repository
- run `npm install` (or `yarn install` if you don't use NPM)
- run the app using `npm start` (or `yarn start`)
- to build project use `npm run build` (od `yarn run build`)
- enjoy!
